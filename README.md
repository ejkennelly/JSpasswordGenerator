# JSpasswordGenerator
For this project I created a password generator that met the following requirements;
    length of no less than 8 and no more than 128 characters,
    included at least one of the following- 
        a number, an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, or a special character.

I tried to keep the code as concise as possible.
